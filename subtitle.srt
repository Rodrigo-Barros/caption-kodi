1
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:18,534
Some months back,
I was visiting this East African city,

2
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:21,547
and we were stuck in traffic.

3
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:24,613
And this vendor suddenly
approaches my window

4
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:27,180
with a half-opened alphabet sheet.

5
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:31,324
I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,

6
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:32,783
and I thought of my daughter,

7
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:35,369
how it would be nice
to spread it on the floor

8
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:37,233
and just play all over it with her

9
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:39,446
while getting her to learn the alphabet.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,765
So the traffic moved a bit,
and I quickly grabbed a copy,

11
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,788
and we moved on.

12
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:49,266
When I had time to fully open
the alphabet sheet

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,619
and take a more detailed look at it,

14
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:54,666
I knew I was not going to use that
to teach my daughter.

15
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:56,784
I regretted my purchase.

16
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,673
Why so?

17
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:03,124 
Looking at the alphabet sheet
reminded me of the fact

18
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:05,524 
that not much has changed

19
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,971 
in the education curricula in Africa.

20
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,449 
Some decades back, I was taught
out of a similar alphabet sheet.

21
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,569 
And because of that,
I struggled for years.

22
00:01:16,464 --> 00:01:20,960 
I struggled to reconcile my reality
with the formal education I received

23
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:23,131 
in school, in the schools I attended.

24
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:26,602 
I had identity crises.

25
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:29,535 
I looked down on my reality.

26
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:33,805 
I looked at my ancestry,
I looked at my lineage with disrespect.

27
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:39,258 
I had very little patience
for what my life had to offer around me.

28
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:42,444 
Why?

29
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:44,915 
&quot;A is for apple.&quot;

30
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,845 
&quot;A is for apple.&quot;

31
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:54,216 
&quot;A is for apple&quot; is for that child
in that part of the world

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,972 
where apples grow out;

33
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,727 
who has an apple in her lunch bag;

34
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:03,637 
who goes to the grocery store
with her mom and sees red,

35
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:07,314 
green, yellow -- apples
of all shapes and colors and sizes.

36
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:10,938 
And so, introducing
education to this child

37
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:13,084 
with an alphabet sheet like this

38
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,131 
fulfills one of the major
functions of education,

39
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:20,317 
which is to introduce the learner

40
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,714 
to an appreciation
of the learner&#39;s environment

41
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:28,380 
and a curiosity to explore more
in order to add value.

42
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:30,992 
In my own case,

43
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:34,326 
when and where I grew up in Africa,

44
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,443 
apple was an exotic fruit.

45
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,104 
Two or three times a year,

46
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:45,495 
I could get some yellowish apples
with brown dots, you know,

47
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,416 
signifying thousands of miles traveled --
warehouses storing --

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,614 
to get to me.

49
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:53,486 
I grew up in the city

50
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,510 
to very financially comfortable parents,

51
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:58,476 
so it was my dignified reality,

52
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,811 
exactly the same way

53
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:04,997 
cassava fufu or ugali
would not regularly feature

54
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,922 
in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,

55
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:11,280 
apples didn&#39;t count as part of my reality.

56
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,256 
So what this did to me,

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,964 
introducing education to me
with &quot;A is for apple,&quot;

58
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:21,447 
made education an abstraction.

59
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:23,783 
It made it something out of my reach --

60
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,571 
a foreign concept,

61
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:30,401 
a phenomenon for which I would have
to constantly and perpetually seek

62
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:32,236 
the validation of those it belonged to

63
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,200 
for me to make progress
within it and with it.

64
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:39,015 
That was tough for a child;
it would be tough for anyone.

65
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,765 
As I grew up and I advanced academically,

66
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:47,853 
my reality was further separated
from my education.

67
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,485 
In history, I was taught

68
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:54,760 
that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park
discovered the Niger River.

69
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,424 
And so it bothered me.

70
00:03:57,448 --> 00:03:59,463 
My great-great-grandparents grew up

71
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:01,490 
quite close to the edge
of the Niger River.

72
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:03,933 
(Laughter)

73
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:10,434 
And it took someone to travel
thousands of miles from Europe

74
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,905 
to discover a river
right under their nose?

75
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,370 
(Laughter)

76
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:16,551 
No!

77
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:21,994 
(Applause and cheers)

78
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:23,947 
What did they do with their time?

79
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,868 
(Laughter)

80
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,723 
Playing board games, roasting fresh yams,

81
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:30,127 
fighting tribal wars?

82
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:35,417 
I mean, I just knew my education
was preparing me to go somewhere else

83
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,208 
and practice and give to another
environment that it belonged to.

84
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:42,415 
It was not for my environment,
where and when I grew up.

85
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,188 
And this continued.

86
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:46,105 
This philosophy undergirded my studies

87
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,594 
all through the time I studied in Africa.

88
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:52,452 
It took a lot of experiences
and some studies

89
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:55,628 
for me to begin to have
a change of mindset.

90
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:58,616 
I will share a couple
of the remarkable ones with us.

91
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:02,090 
I was in the United States
in Washington, DC

92
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,156 
studying towards my doctorate,

93
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,057 
and I got this consultancy position
with the World Bank Africa Region.

94
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,491 
And so I remember one day,

95
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:16,163 
my boss -- we were having
a conversation on some project,

96
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:19,228 
and he mentioned a particular
World Bank project,

97
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:24,224 
a large-scale irrigation project
that cost millions of dollars

98
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,579 
in Niger Republic

99
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:28,877 
that was faltering sustainably.

100
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,244 
He said this project
wasn&#39;t so sustainable,

101
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:35,491 
and it bothered those
that instituted the whole package.

102
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,824 
But then he mentioned
a particular project,

103
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:44,434 
a particular traditional irrigation method
that was hugely successful

104
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:48,155 
in the same Niger Republic
where the World Bank project was failing.

105
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,426 
And that got me thinking.

106
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,024 
So I did further research,

107
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:56,369 
and I found out about Tassa.

108
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:01,545 
Tassa is a traditional irrigation method

109
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:07,762 
where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide
and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes

110
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,660 
are dug across a field to be cultivated.

111
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,333 
Then, a small dam is constructed
around the field,

112
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:19,922 
and then crops are planted
across the surface area.

113
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,250 
What happens is that when rain falls,

114
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:26,258 
the holes are able to store the water

115
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:30,100 
and appropriate it to the extent
that the plant needs the water.

116
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:33,390 
The plant can only assimilate
as much water as needed

117
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:34,984 
until harvest time.

118
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:40,275 
Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,

119
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,992 
so this is something
that is a life-or-death situation,

120
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,824 
and it has been used for centuries.

121
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:47,486 
In an experiment that was conducted,

122
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:53,646 
two similar plots of land
were used in the experiment,

123
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,301 
and one plot of land

124
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:58,267 
did not have the Tassa technique on it.

125
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,458 
Similar plots.

126
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,640 
The other one had Tassa technique
constructed on it.

127
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:07,087 
Then similar grains of millet
also were planted on both plots.

128
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,252 
During harvest time,

129
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:13,428 
the plot of land without Tassa technique

130
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:17,623 
yielded 11 kilograms
of millet per hectare.

131
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,032 
The plot of land with Tassa technique

132
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:26,909 
yielded 553 kilograms
of millet per hectare.

133
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,245 
(Applause)

134
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:34,182 
I looked at the research,
and I looked at myself.

135
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:37,458 
I said, &quot;I studied
agriculture for 12 years,

136
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:40,892 
from primary to Senior Six,
as we say in East Africa,

137
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,262 
SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.

138
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:44,943 
No one ever taught me

139
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,773 
of any form of traditional
African knowledge of cultivation --

140
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:50,591 
of harvesting, of anything --

141
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:54,443 
that will work in modern times
and actually succeed,

142
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:59,068 
where something imported from the West
would struggle to succeed.

143
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:02,888 
That was when I knew the challenge,

144
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:05,491 
the challenge of Africa&#39;s curricula,

145
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,447 
And I thus began my quest
to dedicate my life, concern my life work,

146
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:14,763 
to studying, conducting research
on Africa&#39;s own knowledge system

147
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,787 
and being able to advocate
for its mainstreaming

148
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,658 
in education, in research, policy

149
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,737 
across sectors and industries.

150
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:27,289 
Another conversation
and experience I had at the bank

151
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:32,063 
I guess made me take that final decision
of where I was going to go,

152
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:36,111 
even though it wasn&#39;t the most lucrative
research to go into,

153
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:38,452 
but it was just about what I believed in.

154
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:43,563 
And so one day, my boss said
that he likes to go to Africa

155
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:48,123 
to negotiate World Bank loans
and to work on World Bank projects.

156
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:50,563 
And I was intrigued. I asked him why.

157
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:53,033 
He said, &quot;Oh, when I go to Africa,

158
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:54,766 
it&#39;s so easy.

159
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:59,913 
I just write up my loan documents
and my project proposal in Washington, DC,

160
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:02,890 
I go to Africa, and they all
just get signed.

161
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:06,302 
I get the best deal, and I&#39;m back to base.

162
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,533 
My bosses are happy with me.&quot;

163
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:12,620 
But then he said,
&quot;I hate going to Asia or ...&quot;

164
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:16,087 
and he mentioned a particular country,
Asia and some of these countries.

165
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:20,134 
&quot;They keep me for this, trying
to get the best deal for their countries.

166
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,334 
They get the best deal.

167
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:24,266 
They tell me, &#39;Oh,
that clause will not work for us

168
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,897 
in our environment.

169
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,894 
It&#39;s not our reality.
It&#39;s just so Western.&#39;

170
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:32,029 
And they tell me, &#39;Oh,
we have enough experts

171
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:33,256 
to take care of this.

172
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,901 
You don&#39;t have enough experts.

173
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,078 
We know our aim.&#39;

174
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:38,547 
And they just keep going
through all these things.

175
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:41,091 
By the time they finish,
yes, they get the best deal,

176
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,280 
but I&#39;m so exhausted and I don&#39;t get
the best deal for the bank,

177
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:45,483 
and we&#39;re in business.&quot;

178
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,302 
&quot;Really?&quot; I thought in my head, &quot;OK.&quot;

179
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:51,606 
I was privileged to sit in on
a loan negotiating session

180
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,295 
in an African country.

181
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,139 
So I would do these consultancy
positions during summer,

182
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,847 
you know, since I was a doctoral student.

183
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:03,203 
And then I traveled with the team,
with the World Bank team,

184
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:07,543 
as more like someone to help out
with organizational matters.

185
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,834 
But I sat in during
the negotiating session.

186
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,662 
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know,
with me from Washington, DC.

187
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:21,536 
And I looked across the table
at my African brothers and sisters.

188
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,327 
I could see intimidation on their faces.

189
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,034 
They didn&#39;t believe
they had anything to offer

190
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:29,346 
the great-great-grandchildren
of Mungo Park --

191
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,987 
the owners of &quot;apple&quot; in &quot;A is for apple.&quot;

192
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,787 
They just sat and watched:
&quot;Oh, just give us, let us sign.

193
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:36,724 
You own the knowledge. You know it all.

194
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:38,957 
Just, where do we sign?
Show us, let us sign.&quot;

195
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:42,017 
They had no voice.
They didn&#39;t believe in themselves.

196
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:47,727 
Excuse me.

197
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:49,759 
And so,

198
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:53,538 
I have been doing this for a decade.

199
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:57,006 
I have been conducting research
on Africa&#39;s knowledge system,

200
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,274 
original, authentic,
traditional knowledge.

201
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:02,495 
In the few cases where this
has been implemented in Africa,

202
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,003 
there has been remarkable
successes recorded.

203
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:06,564 
I think of Gacaca.

204
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:11,988 
Gacaca is Rwanda&#39;s traditional
judicial system

205
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:14,106 
that was used after the genocide.

206
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,561 
In 1994, when the genocide ended,

207
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,662 
Rwanda&#39;s national court system
was in shambles:

208
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:26,212 
no judges, no lawyers to try
hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.

209
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:29,744 
So the government of Rwanda
came up with this idea

210
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:33,163 
to resuscitate a traditional
judicial system known as Gacaca.

211
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,072 
Gacaca is a community-based
judicial system,

212
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,033 
where community members come together

213
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:43,806 
to elect men and women of proven integrity

214
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,340 
to try cases of crimes committed
within these communities.

215
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:54,732 
So by the time Gacaca concluded
its trial of genocide cases in 2012,

216
00:11:55,619 --> 00:12:02,594 
12,000 community-based courts
had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.

217
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,686 
That&#39;s a record.

218
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:10,150 
(Applause)

219
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:16,038 
Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized
Rwanda&#39;s traditional philosophy

220
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:19,155 
of reconciliation and reintegration,

221
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:23,057 
as against the whole
punitive and banishment idea

222
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:26,803 
that undergirds present-day Western style.

223
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:31,376 
And not to compare, but just to say
that it really emphasized

224
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,754 
Rwanda&#39;s traditional method of philosophy.

225
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,866 
And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,

226
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,631 
former president of Tanzania --

227
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,131 
(Applause)

228
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:44,331 
who said that you cannot develop people.

229
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,974 
People will have to develop themselves.

230
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:49,948 
I agree with Mwalimu.

231
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:51,875 
I am convinced

232
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,522 
that Africa&#39;s further transformation,
Africa&#39;s advancement,

233
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:55,325 
rests simply in the acknowledgment,
validation and mainstreaming

234
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:05,338 
of Africa&#39;s own traditional, authentic,
original, indigenous knowledge

235
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:10,233 
in education, in research,
in policy making and across sectors.

236
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:13,333 
This is not going to be easy for Africa.

237
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,821 
It is not going to be easy for a people
used to being told how to think,

238
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:19,210 
what to do, how to go about it,

239
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:22,388 
a people long subjected
to the intellectual guidance

240
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,154 
and direction of others,

241
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,845 
be they the colonial masters,

242
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,841 
aid industry or international news media.

243
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:32,099 
But it is a task that we have to do
to make progress.

244
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:35,023 
I am strengthened by the words
of Joseph Shabalala,

245
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,521 
founder of the South African choral group
Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

246
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:44,232 
He said that the task ahead of us
can never, ever be greater

247
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,409 
than the power within us.

248
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,591 
We can do it.

249
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:50,175 
We can unlearn looking down on ourselves.

250
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,394 
We can learn to place value
on our reality and our knowledge.

251
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,573 
Thank you.

252
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:57,068 
(Swahili) Thank you very much.

253
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,615 
(Applause)

254
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:58,841 
Thank you. Thank you.

255
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:05,564 
(Applause)
