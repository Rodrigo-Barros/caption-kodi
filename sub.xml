<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="13.054" dur="5.48">Some months back,
I was visiting this East African city,</text><text start="18.558" dur="2.989">and we were stuck in traffic.</text><text start="21.571" dur="3.042">And this vendor suddenly
approaches my window</text><text start="24.637" dur="2.543">with a half-opened alphabet sheet.</text><text start="28.505" dur="2.819">I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,</text><text start="31.348" dur="1.435">and I thought of my daughter,</text><text start="32.807" dur="2.562">how it would be nice
to spread it on the floor</text><text start="35.393" dur="1.84">and just play all over it with her</text><text start="37.257" dur="2.189">while getting her to learn the alphabet.</text><text start="39.47" dur="3.295">So the traffic moved a bit,
and I quickly grabbed a copy,</text><text start="42.789" dur="1.999">and we moved on.</text><text start="46.165" dur="3.101">When I had time to fully open
the alphabet sheet</text><text start="49.29" dur="2.329">and take a more detailed look at it,</text><text start="51.643" dur="3.023">I knew I was not going to use that
to teach my daughter.</text><text start="55.267" dur="1.517">I regretted my purchase.</text><text start="58.331" dur="1.342">Why so?</text><text start="60.338" dur="2.786">Looking at the alphabet sheet
reminded me of the fact</text><text start="63.148" dur="2.376">that not much has changed</text><text start="65.548" dur="2.423">in the education curricula in Africa.</text><text start="68.729" dur="3.72">Some decades back, I was taught
out of a similar alphabet sheet.</text><text start="73.312" dur="2.257">And because of that,
I struggled for years.</text><text start="76.464" dur="4.496">I struggled to reconcile my reality
with the formal education I received</text><text start="80.984" dur="2.147">in school, in the schools I attended.</text><text start="84.592" dur="2.01">I had identity crises.</text><text start="86.626" dur="2.909">I looked down on my reality.</text><text start="89.559" dur="4.246">I looked at my ancestry,
I looked at my lineage with disrespect.</text><text start="94.205" dur="5.053">I had very little patience
for what my life had to offer around me.</text><text start="101.045" dur="1.399">Why?</text><text start="103.496" dur="1.419">&amp;quot;A is for apple.&amp;quot;</text><text start="106.421" dur="1.424">&amp;quot;A is for apple.&amp;quot;</text><text start="109.528" dur="4.688">&amp;quot;A is for apple&amp;quot; is for that child
in that part of the world</text><text start="114.24" dur="1.732">where apples grow out;</text><text start="116.751" dur="1.976">who has an apple in her lunch bag;</text><text start="120.235" dur="3.402">who goes to the grocery store
with her mom and sees red,</text><text start="123.661" dur="3.653">green, yellow -- apples
of all shapes and colors and sizes.</text><text start="128.049" dur="2.889">And so, introducing
education to this child</text><text start="130.962" dur="2.122">with an alphabet sheet like this</text><text start="134.09" dur="3.041">fulfills one of the major
functions of education,</text><text start="137.155" dur="3.162">which is to introduce the learner</text><text start="140.341" dur="3.373">to an appreciation
of the learner&amp;#39;s environment</text><text start="143.738" dur="4.642">and a curiosity to explore more
in order to add value.</text><text start="149.581" dur="1.411">In my own case,</text><text start="152.014" dur="2.312">when and where I grew up in Africa,</text><text start="155.613" dur="1.83">apple was an exotic fruit.</text><text start="158.719" dur="1.385">Two or three times a year,</text><text start="160.128" dur="5.367">I could get some yellowish apples
with brown dots, you know,</text><text start="165.519" dur="3.897">signifying thousands of miles traveled --
warehouses storing --</text><text start="169.44" dur="1.174">to get to me.</text><text start="171.575" dur="1.911">I grew up in the city</text><text start="173.51" dur="3">to very financially comfortable parents,</text><text start="176.534" dur="1.942">so it was my dignified reality,</text><text start="178.5" dur="2.311">exactly the same way</text><text start="180.835" dur="4.162">cassava fufu or ugali
would not regularly feature</text><text start="185.021" dur="2.901">in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,</text><text start="188.851" dur="2.429">apples didn&amp;#39;t count as part of my reality.</text><text start="192.208" dur="3.048">So what this did to me,</text><text start="195.28" dur="3.684">introducing education to me
with &amp;quot;A is for apple,&amp;quot;</text><text start="198.988" dur="2.459">made education an abstraction.</text><text start="201.914" dur="1.869">It made it something out of my reach --</text><text start="204.665" dur="1.906">a foreign concept,</text><text start="206.595" dur="3.806">a phenomenon for which I would have
to constantly and perpetually seek</text><text start="210.425" dur="1.811">the validation of those it belonged to</text><text start="212.26" dur="2.94">for me to make progress
within it and with it.</text><text start="216.109" dur="2.906">That was tough for a child;
it would be tough for anyone.</text><text start="220.042" dur="2.723">As I grew up and I advanced academically,</text><text start="222.789" dur="5.064">my reality was further separated
from my education.</text><text start="228.739" dur="1.746">In history, I was taught</text><text start="230.509" dur="4.251">that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park
discovered the Niger River.</text><text start="235.631" dur="1.793">And so it bothered me.</text><text start="237.448" dur="2.015">My great-great-grandparents grew up</text><text start="239.487" dur="2.003">quite close to the edge
of the Niger River.</text><text start="241.514" dur="2.419">(Laughter)</text><text start="243.957" dur="6.477">And it took someone to travel
thousands of miles from Europe</text><text start="250.458" dur="2.447">to discover a river
right under their nose?</text><text start="252.929" dur="2.441">(Laughter)</text><text start="255.394" dur="1.157">No!</text><text start="256.575" dur="5.419">(Applause and cheers)</text><text start="262.018" dur="1.929">What did they do with their time?</text><text start="263.971" dur="1.897">(Laughter)</text><text start="265.892" dur="2.831">Playing board games, roasting fresh yams,</text><text start="268.747" dur="1.38">fighting tribal wars?</text><text start="270.557" dur="4.86">I mean, I just knew my education
was preparing me to go somewhere else</text><text start="275.441" dur="3.767">and practice and give to another
environment that it belonged to.</text><text start="279.232" dur="3.183">It was not for my environment,
where and when I grew up.</text><text start="283.029" dur="1.159">And this continued.</text><text start="284.212" dur="1.893">This philosophy undergirded my studies</text><text start="286.129" dur="2.465">all through the time I studied in Africa.</text><text start="288.618" dur="3.834">It took a lot of experiences
and some studies</text><text start="292.476" dur="3.152">for me to begin to have
a change of mindset.</text><text start="295.652" dur="2.964">I will share a couple
of the remarkable ones with us.</text><text start="299.735" dur="2.355">I was in the United States
in Washington, DC</text><text start="302.114" dur="2.042">studying towards my doctorate,</text><text start="304.18" dur="3.877">and I got this consultancy position
with the World Bank Africa Region.</text><text start="308.735" dur="2.756">And so I remember one day,</text><text start="311.515" dur="4.648">my boss -- we were having
a conversation on some project,</text><text start="316.187" dur="3.041">and he mentioned a particular
World Bank project,</text><text start="319.252" dur="4.972">a large-scale irrigation project
that cost millions of dollars</text><text start="324.248" dur="1.331">in Niger Republic</text><text start="325.603" dur="3.274">that was faltering sustainably.</text><text start="328.901" dur="2.343">He said this project
wasn&amp;#39;t so sustainable,</text><text start="331.268" dur="4.223">and it bothered those
that instituted the whole package.</text><text start="336.035" dur="2.789">But then he mentioned
a particular project,</text><text start="339.517" dur="4.917">a particular traditional irrigation method
that was hugely successful</text><text start="344.458" dur="3.697">in the same Niger Republic
where the World Bank project was failing.</text><text start="348.93" dur="1.496">And that got me thinking.</text><text start="351.281" dur="1.743">So I did further research,</text><text start="353.984" dur="2.385">and I found out about Tassa.</text><text start="357.775" dur="3.77">Tassa is a traditional irrigation method</text><text start="361.569" dur="6.193">where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide
and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes</text><text start="367.786" dur="2.874">are dug across a field to be cultivated.</text><text start="371.22" dur="4.113">Then, a small dam is constructed
around the field,</text><text start="376.296" dur="3.626">and then crops are planted
across the surface area.</text><text start="379.946" dur="3.304">What happens is that when rain falls,</text><text start="383.274" dur="2.984">the holes are able to store the water</text><text start="386.282" dur="3.818">and appropriate it to the extent
that the plant needs the water.</text><text start="390.124" dur="3.266">The plant can only assimilate
as much water as needed</text><text start="393.414" dur="1.57">until harvest time.</text><text start="396.582" dur="3.693">Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,</text><text start="400.299" dur="2.693">so this is something
that is a life-or-death situation,</text><text start="403.016" dur="1.808">and it has been used for centuries.</text><text start="405.384" dur="2.102">In an experiment that was conducted,</text><text start="408.233" dur="5.413">two similar plots of land
were used in the experiment,</text><text start="413.67" dur="2.631">and one plot of land</text><text start="416.325" dur="1.942">did not have the Tassa technique on it.</text><text start="418.291" dur="1.167">Similar plots.</text><text start="419.482" dur="3.158">The other one had Tassa technique
constructed on it.</text><text start="423.332" dur="3.755">Then similar grains of millet
also were planted on both plots.</text><text start="428.045" dur="2.207">During harvest time,</text><text start="430.276" dur="3.152">the plot of land without Tassa technique</text><text start="433.452" dur="4.171">yielded 11 kilograms
of millet per hectare.</text><text start="438.737" dur="2.295">The plot of land with Tassa technique</text><text start="441.056" dur="5.853">yielded 553 kilograms
of millet per hectare.</text><text start="447.66" dur="2.585">(Applause)</text><text start="450.269" dur="3.913">I looked at the research,
and I looked at myself.</text><text start="454.206" dur="3.252">I said, &amp;quot;I studied
agriculture for 12 years,</text><text start="457.482" dur="3.41">from primary to Senior Six,
as we say in East Africa,</text><text start="460.916" dur="2.346">SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.</text><text start="463.286" dur="1.657">No one ever taught me</text><text start="464.967" dur="3.806">of any form of traditional
African knowledge of cultivation --</text><text start="468.797" dur="1.794">of harvesting, of anything --</text><text start="470.615" dur="3.828">that will work in modern times
and actually succeed,</text><text start="474.467" dur="4.601">where something imported from the West
would struggle to succeed.</text><text start="479.775" dur="3.113">That was when I knew the challenge,</text><text start="482.912" dur="2.579">the challenge of Africa&amp;#39;s curricula,</text><text start="485.649" dur="4.798">And I thus began my quest
to dedicate my life, concern my life work,</text><text start="490.471" dur="4.292">to studying, conducting research
on Africa&amp;#39;s own knowledge system</text><text start="494.787" dur="3">and being able to advocate
for its mainstreaming</text><text start="497.811" dur="2.847">in education, in research, policy</text><text start="500.682" dur="2.055">across sectors and industries.</text><text start="503.445" dur="3.844">Another conversation
and experience I had at the bank</text><text start="507.313" dur="4.75">I guess made me take that final decision
of where I was going to go,</text><text start="512.087" dur="4.024">even though it wasn&amp;#39;t the most lucrative
research to go into,</text><text start="516.135" dur="2.317">but it was just about what I believed in.</text><text start="518.937" dur="4.626">And so one day, my boss said
that he likes to go to Africa</text><text start="523.587" dur="4.536">to negotiate World Bank loans
and to work on World Bank projects.</text><text start="528.614" dur="1.949">And I was intrigued. I asked him why.</text><text start="530.587" dur="2.446">He said, &amp;quot;Oh, when I go to Africa,</text><text start="533.057" dur="1.709">it&amp;#39;s so easy.</text><text start="535.255" dur="4.658">I just write up my loan documents
and my project proposal in Washington, DC,</text><text start="539.937" dur="2.953">I go to Africa, and they all
just get signed.</text><text start="542.914" dur="3.388">I get the best deal, and I&amp;#39;m back to base.</text><text start="546.326" dur="2.207">My bosses are happy with me.&amp;quot;</text><text start="548.933" dur="3.687">But then he said,
&amp;quot;I hate going to Asia or ...&amp;quot;</text><text start="552.644" dur="3.443">and he mentioned a particular country,
Asia and some of these countries.</text><text start="556.111" dur="4.023">&amp;quot;They keep me for this, trying
to get the best deal for their countries.</text><text start="560.158" dur="1.176">They get the best deal.</text><text start="561.358" dur="2.908">They tell me, &amp;#39;Oh,
that clause will not work for us</text><text start="564.29" dur="1.607">in our environment.</text><text start="565.921" dur="2.973">It&amp;#39;s not our reality.
It&amp;#39;s just so Western.&amp;#39;</text><text start="568.918" dur="3.111">And they tell me, &amp;#39;Oh,
we have enough experts</text><text start="572.053" dur="1.203">to take care of this.</text><text start="573.28" dur="1.621">You don&amp;#39;t have enough experts.</text><text start="574.925" dur="1.153">We know our aim.&amp;#39;</text><text start="576.102" dur="2.445">And they just keep going
through all these things.</text><text start="578.571" dur="2.52">By the time they finish,
yes, they get the best deal,</text><text start="581.115" dur="3.165">but I&amp;#39;m so exhausted and I don&amp;#39;t get
the best deal for the bank,</text><text start="584.304" dur="1.179">and we&amp;#39;re in business.&amp;quot;</text><text start="585.507" dur="1.795">&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; I thought in my head, &amp;quot;OK.&amp;quot;</text><text start="587.326" dur="4.28">I was privileged to sit in on
a loan negotiating session</text><text start="591.63" dur="1.665">in an African country.</text><text start="593.319" dur="2.82">So I would do these consultancy
positions during summer,</text><text start="596.163" dur="2.684">you know, since I was a doctoral student.</text><text start="598.871" dur="4.332">And then I traveled with the team,
with the World Bank team,</text><text start="603.227" dur="4.316">as more like someone to help out
with organizational matters.</text><text start="607.567" dur="3.267">But I sat in during
the negotiating session.</text><text start="611.73" dur="4.932">I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know,
with me from Washington, DC.</text><text start="616.686" dur="4.85">And I looked across the table
at my African brothers and sisters.</text><text start="621.993" dur="2.334">I could see intimidation on their faces.</text><text start="624.771" dur="2.263">They didn&amp;#39;t believe
they had anything to offer</text><text start="627.058" dur="2.288">the great-great-grandchildren
of Mungo Park --</text><text start="629.37" dur="2.617">the owners of &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;A is for apple.&amp;quot;</text><text start="632.011" dur="2.776">They just sat and watched:
&amp;quot;Oh, just give us, let us sign.</text><text start="634.811" dur="1.913">You own the knowledge. You know it all.</text><text start="636.748" dur="2.209">Just, where do we sign?
Show us, let us sign.&amp;quot;</text><text start="638.981" dur="3.036">They had no voice.
They didn&amp;#39;t believe in themselves.</text><text start="646.544" dur="1.183">Excuse me.</text><text start="648.587" dur="1.172">And so,</text><text start="651.212" dur="2.326">I have been doing this for a decade.</text><text start="653.562" dur="3.444">I have been conducting research
on Africa&amp;#39;s knowledge system,</text><text start="657.03" dur="2.244">original, authentic,
traditional knowledge.</text><text start="659.298" dur="3.197">In the few cases where this
has been implemented in Africa,</text><text start="662.519" dur="2.484">there has been remarkable
successes recorded.</text><text start="665.027" dur="1.537">I think of Gacaca.</text><text start="667.256" dur="4.732">Gacaca is Rwanda&amp;#39;s traditional
judicial system</text><text start="672.012" dur="2.094">that was used after the genocide.</text><text start="674.13" dur="2.431">In 1994, when the genocide ended,</text><text start="678.1" dur="2.562">Rwanda&amp;#39;s national court system
was in shambles:</text><text start="680.686" dur="5.526">no judges, no lawyers to try
hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.</text><text start="686.236" dur="3.508">So the government of Rwanda
came up with this idea</text><text start="689.768" dur="3.395">to resuscitate a traditional
judicial system known as Gacaca.</text><text start="693.625" dur="3.447">Gacaca is a community-based
judicial system,</text><text start="697.096" dur="2.937">where community members come together</text><text start="700.057" dur="3.749">to elect men and women of proven integrity</text><text start="703.83" dur="4.51">to try cases of crimes committed
within these communities.</text><text start="709.255" dur="5.477">So by the time Gacaca concluded
its trial of genocide cases in 2012,</text><text start="715.619" dur="6.975">12,000 community-based courts
had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.</text><text start="723.334" dur="1.352">That&amp;#39;s a record.</text><text start="725.169" dur="4.981">(Applause)</text><text start="730.438" dur="5.6">Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized
Rwanda&amp;#39;s traditional philosophy</text><text start="736.062" dur="3.093">of reconciliation and reintegration,</text><text start="739.179" dur="3.878">as against the whole
punitive and banishment idea</text><text start="743.081" dur="3.722">that undergirds present-day Western style.</text><text start="747.481" dur="3.895">And not to compare, but just to say
that it really emphasized</text><text start="751.4" dur="3.354">Rwanda&amp;#39;s traditional method of philosophy.</text><text start="755.269" dur="2.597">And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,</text><text start="757.89" dur="1.741">former president of Tanzania --</text><text start="759.655" dur="1.476">(Applause)</text><text start="761.155" dur="3.176">who said that you cannot develop people.</text><text start="764.916" dur="3.058">People will have to develop themselves.</text><text start="768.563" dur="1.385">I agree with Mwalimu.</text><text start="770.487" dur="1.388">I am convinced</text><text start="771.899" dur="3.623">that Africa&amp;#39;s further transformation,
Africa&amp;#39;s advancement,</text><text start="775.546" dur="4.779">rests simply in the acknowledgment,
validation and mainstreaming</text><text start="780.349" dur="4.989">of Africa&amp;#39;s own traditional, authentic,
original, indigenous knowledge</text><text start="785.362" dur="4.871">in education, in research,
in policy making and across sectors.</text><text start="790.816" dur="2.517">This is not going to be easy for Africa.</text><text start="793.357" dur="3.464">It is not going to be easy for a people
used to being told how to think,</text><text start="796.845" dur="2.365">what to do, how to go about it,</text><text start="799.234" dur="3.154">a people long subjected
to the intellectual guidance</text><text start="802.412" dur="1.742">and direction of others,</text><text start="804.178" dur="1.667">be they the colonial masters,</text><text start="805.869" dur="2.972">aid industry or international news media.</text><text start="808.865" dur="3.234">But it is a task that we have to do
to make progress.</text><text start="812.123" dur="2.9">I am strengthened by the words
of Joseph Shabalala,</text><text start="815.047" dur="3.474">founder of the South African choral group
